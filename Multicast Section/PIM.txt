QUESTIONS:
1. Why do we still need RP if we can do SPT directly instead?
2. Instead of rejecting, is there a buffer for RPs when receiving multicast traffic if there are still no receivers?
3. 

If you are configuring PIM sparse mode, you must configure a PIM RP for a multicast group. An RP can either be configured statically in each device, or learned through a dynamic mechanism. Look at scenarios and topology.

Sparse Mode
- Forward multicast traffic if requested

Dense Mode
- Forward multicast traffic

Rendezvous Point
- Meeting point
- Used by PIM sparse

Root Path Tree (RPT) / Shared Distribution Tree
- Concept of joining the Rendezvous Point.

Shorter Path Tree (SPT)
- PIM join messages towards the source using the best path.
- Usage of PIM Prune towards RP.

Bootstrap Router
- BSR mechanism that allows multicast routers to learn set of group-to-RP mappings.

Multicast Traffic:
1. RP rejects PIM Register if source starts sending multicast traffic without any receivers.
2. suppression timer default timer is 60 seconds, then source starts sending multicast traffic again.
3. IGMP membership report to join multicast group
4. PIM sparse routers will send PIM join if:
	It has received an IGMP membership report from a host.
	Received PIM join from a downstream router.
5. Once learning source address, SPT is inevitable then send PIM Prune

TLDR:
1. PIM Register, source sending multicast traffic.
OPTIONAL - IGMP Membership, join interfaces into a multicast group.
2. PIM Join, RPT/SDT.
3. PIM Prune, SPT, PIM Join towards best path.

Scenarios:
Configuring Sparse Mode with a Bootstrap Router
1. For every multicast router, multicast routing is disabled by default
ip multicast-routing

2. For every interface participating in multicast path
interface {interface}
 ip pim sparse-mode
 
2.1 **OPTIONAL** For DMVPN topology (I'm using EIGRP DMVPN Phase 3 as an example)
ip nhrp map multicast dynamic
or
ip nhrp map multicast {peer-nbma-address}
ip nhrp map multicast {peer-nbma-address}

3. For RP router
ip pim bsr-candidate {interface} [hash-length[priority]]
ip pim rp-candidate {interface} [group-list [access-list]] [priority [priority]]

4. **OPTIONAL** Join interfaces into multicast group
interface {interface}
ip igmp join-group {multicast-address}

Configuring Sparse Mode with a Single Static RP
ip multicast-routing
interface {interface}
 ip pim sparse-mode
 ip igmp join-group {multicast-address}
no ip pim autorp
ip pim rp-address {rp-address} [access-list] override

Configuring Bidirectional PIM
ip multicast-routing
interface {interface}
 ip pim sparse-mode
ip pim bidir-enable
no ip pim autorp
To prevent RP address conflict for dynamic and static RP mapping
Without override, dynamic RP will take precedence
With override, static RP will take precedence
 ip pim rp-address override

Configuring Sparse Mode with Auto-RP
ip multicast-routing
ip pim autorp listener
ip pim send-rp-announce {loopback} scope {n} [group-list] {n}
ip pim send-rp-discovery {loopback} scope {n}
Prevents routers treating topology as dense if no RP is configured
 no ip pim dm-fallback
