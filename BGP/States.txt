TROUBLESHOOT:
    1. Idle
        - No route to the source address from BGP Open Packet is found in the routing table.
        - AS number is misconfigured.
        - The neighbor is peering with the wrong address.
        - No neighbor statement for the router.
    2. Active
        -   Most common problem is AS is misconfigured.
        - Another common problem is that the neighbor might not have a return route to the source address. Ensure that the source IP address have been advertised from the local routing protocol (IGP).
